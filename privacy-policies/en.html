  <h2 id="our-responsible-data-promise">Our responsible data promise</h2>
  <p>As a non-profit organization, Medic Mobile (“Medic”)’s mission is to advance good health and human flourishing by
    building open source technology with and for hard-to-reach communities. We value humanity, creativity, initiative,
    solidarity, and openness. Being responsible stewards of people’s data is critically important to our mission.</p>
  <p>We use the concept of Responsible Data (RD) to outline our collective duty to prioritise and respond to the
    ethical, legal, social, and privacy-related challenges that come from using data in new and different ways in
    healthcare, advocacy, and social change. We have an obligation to account for unintended consequences of working
    with data by:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Prioritising people’s rights to consent, privacy, security and ownership when using data in social change and
      advocacy efforts</li>
    <li>Implementing values and practices of transparency and openness</li>
  </ol>
  <p>As an organization, we promise to do our best to live up to these obligations. We promise to show initiative, to
    seek feedback, and to proactively seek out ways to work with data more responsibly. We promise to accompany
    patients, health workers, researchers, organizational partners, and our open source community in the journey from
    best intentions to best practices in data-driven projects. The purpose of Medic’s data policy is to help our
    organization deliver on this responsible data promise.</p>

  <h2 id="compliance-with-applicable-data-regulations-and-policies">Compliance with applicable data regulations and
    policies</h2>
  <p>Medic serves as a technical partner to governments and non-governmental organizations around the world. As a
    result, our projects comply with a range of country-specific and region-specific data protection regulations, and
    the details of compliance are addressed on a project-by-project basis. Adhering to all data regulations that are
    relevant to a given project is a central element of Medic’s global privacy and data protection policy.</p>
  <p>In most cases, the Ministries of Health, other government agencies, and non-governmental organizations that Medic
    supports (Medic “Partner(s)”) serve as data controlling entities, and they work with Medic as a business associate.
    Partners establish additional data handling policies and standard operating procedures, which are typically
    documented in Memoranda of Understanding or/and Data Sharing Agreements signed by these Partners as well as Medic.

  <h2 id="data-and-protected-health-information">Data and protected health information</h2>

  <h3 id="use-of-software-to-collect-and-process-data">Use of software to collect and process data</h3>
  <p>Medic has developed an open-source software toolkit (“Software”) that combines smart messaging, decision support,
    easy data gathering and management, and health system analytics. The Software can be accessed via many types of
    devices, including feature phones, smartphones, tablets, and desktop computers. Certain aspects of the Software can
    be downloaded for use on such end user devices. Health workers and families can use the Software to help monitor
    pregnancies, track outbreaks faster, treat illnesses, keep stock of essential medicines, and communicate about
    emergencies, among other things.</p>
  <p>The Software is made available to the public on a free and open source basis, under licenses approved by the Open
    Source Initiative. These licenses limit Medic’s liability or responsibility with respect to any uses of the Software
    in which Medic personnel are not directly involved in Processing Data (defined below). The Software source code and
    the relevant licenses can be accessed at <a href="http://github.com/medic">http://github.com/medic</a>.</p>
  <p>Medic hosts, maintains and supports certain components of the Software on Medic managed servers where Data obtained
    by use of Software on end user devices is received, accessed, handled, and/or stored (collectively, “Processed”).
    “Data” means any and all data, information and other content uploaded, posted, input or transmitted to the Software,
    or generated by the use of the Software, by or on behalf of End Users.</p>
  <p>Subject to compliance with applicable law, Medic and its permitted subcontractors and agents shall not disclose
    Data to any third party and shall not use or access the Data for any purpose, except the following specific
    purposes:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>To provide services or conduct activities as permitted in writing by a Partner acting as the data controlling
      entity for the specific Data being accessed or shared (which may require execution of a memorandum of
      understanding or data use agreement);</li>
    <li>To maintain and improve the Software;</li>
    <li>To perform routine monitoring and public reporting on aggregated Impact Metrics (defined below).</li>
  </ol>
  <p>For the purposes of this policy, “Impact Metrics” refers to aggregated Data which does not include personally
    identifiable information or Protected Health Information (defined below), and which is useful for Medic’s charitable
    purpose of monitoring the use of the Software and understanding its impacts on health systems. Examples of Impact
    Metrics include the total number of households registered in the Software, the total number of health workers using
    the Software, the total number of households visited in a given month, and the total number of Software-supported
    actions on antenatal care, postnatal care, integrated community case management, family planning, malnutrition, and
    immunization services. It may also include aggregate Data concerning COVID-19 services such as community event-based
    surveillance, contact tracing, CHW self-checks, and support for self-isolation provided in Medic-supported projects.
  </p>
  <p>Any Impact Metrics shared with the general public will be aggregated globally; Medic personnel shall not
    de-aggregate the Impact Metrics to identify activities in any particular Country, without obtaining prior written
    consent from the Partner(s) acting as the relevant data controlling entities. Examples of previously reported Impact
    Metrics are available to the public in Medic’s quarterly and annual reports, which can be accessed at <a
      href="https://medic.org/reports/">https://medic.org/reports/</a>.</p>
  <p>All additional uses of data for research and reporting will comply with applicable Ministry of Health policies and
    existing Partner policies for health data access and sharing. Medic personnel shall not use any Data for research
    purposes unless Medic has obtained the prior written consent of the relevant Partner(s), which may involve execution
    of a data sharing agreement.</p>

  <h3 id="protected-health-information-policy">Protected health information policy</h3>
  <p>For purposes of this policy, protected health information (“PHI”) is defined as any physically or
    electronically-encoded information containing at least one of the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>patient name(s);</li>
    <li>patient-related dates (including birth, registration, visit, death);</li>
    <li>patient-related ages;</li>
    <li>patient and/or family phone/fax numbers, e-mail addresses, and/or social media account names;</li>
    <li>references to a patient-related geographical subdivision (if smaller than 20,000 people);</li>
    <li>social security, tax identification, or other patient account numbers;</li>
    <li>patient-related device identifiers, addresses, or serial numbers (including IP addresses, MAC addresses,
      computer/-device serial numbers, beneficiary numbers, account numbers, and personally-identifying URLs);</li>
    <li>licensure information (including drivers' license and license plate numbers, and numbers related to professional
      membership/licensing);</li>
    <li>images containing the face of a patient, patient's family member, or any other patient-related contact;</li>
    <li>any

      biometric data describing a patient (including eye/hand measurements, height, weight, or clothing sizes); and</li>
    <li>any unique identifier or code, other than a study-specific unique identifier assigned for purposes of managing
      an approved research protocol.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Medic’s PHI policy requires that:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Access to protected health information – and to devices containing protected health information – must be
      password protected.</li>
    <li>Any and all protected health information must be stored and retrieved using a full-disk encryption system.</li>
    <li>Any device that connects to or uses any of Medic's mission-critical services must use a full-disk encryption
      system at all times.</li>
    <li>When communicating information electronically, any and all protected health information must be protected using
      a secure transfer system.</li>
    <li>Each person is responsible for his/her own compliance. If any person becomes aware of a violation of this
      policy, they have a duty to report the incident directly to Medic's People Operations Manager, and/or COO.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>All Medic personnel sign a Protected Health Information (PHI) policy which mandates the use of full disk
    encryption, secure communication channels, and two factor authentication when handling PHI. This policy applies to
    all Medic personnel -- including, but not limited to, employees, contractors, associates, fellows, interns,
    advisors, and board members. This policy applies to computer equipment and/or systems that are either: (i) property
    of Medic; (ii) property of any Medic personnel; or (iii) used directly by Medic personnel to carry out any assigned
    duties.</p>
  <p>Exceptions to this policy may be granted – on a task-specific or project-specific basis only – at the discretion of
    the CPO or COO. This policy does not confer any ownership of data; Partner-submitted data remains in the control of
    Partner organizations. This policy does not apply to equipment stored in an authorized secure data center / facility
    (e.g. Amazon Web Services), or to equipment wholly owned and operated by an external Partner, or to external
    software deployments to which Medic has no access.</p>

  <h2 id="security-practices">Security practices</h2>
  <p>Medic is committed to data security. In addition to adhering to data security standards established by our
    Partners, we also recognize the security benefits and drawbacks of different technology tools and work with our
    partners to make the best choices and mitigate risk.</p>

  <h3 id="technology-security-overview">Technology security overview</h3>
  <p><strong>Web app:</strong> Medic uses secure transfers over HTTPS for all communication between the browser and our
    web application, with perfect forward secrecy (PFS) and 4096-bit SHA-2 certificates by default. We use a
    non-standard port for SSH access to reduce our exposure to automated brute-force attacks and can configure the web
    app to accept only public key authentication for SSH connections. Access to the web application requires a password,
    and user access can be established to varying degrees using a role-based access control facility (e.g. full access,
    restricted access, data entry only, and data export only).</p>
  <p><strong>Data storage:</strong> Medic uses Amazon Web Services (AWS) with enforced two-factor authentication, HTTPS,
    and Identity and Access Management (IAM) for all hosted instances. We use IAM policies on AWS to restrict what any
    one individual Medic developer/administrator can do. Please see below for more information on AWS data security.</p>
  <p><strong>SMS:</strong> We train users to input data using simple SMS codes or freeform SMS. We use "plain text
    encoding" which means viewers can see the value but not know the context of the data. As an example: when health
    workers text P 3 Jane ("P" for pregnancy, "3" for number of weeks pregnant, name), Medic registers the pregnancy,
    creates a patient ID, calculates the expected delivery date, and schedules automated reminder messages. SMS is
    inherently insecure but we work with every partner on safety practices to reduce and minimize mishandling of data
    and transmission of protected health information.</p>
  <p><strong>Android phones:</strong> To secure the data, each device must be configured to use Full Disk Encryption and
    a Screen Lock.</p>

  <h3 id="security-training-for-our-partners">Security training for our Partners</h3>
  <p>We work with every partner to make sure they are trained and equipped to handle their data. This includes advising
    partners on how to create secure passwords and PINs, how to secure hardware, and how to safely transport data.</p>
